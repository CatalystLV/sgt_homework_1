                    JavaScript vs Java

                <div class="part1_text">
                    As Javascript has “Java” in its name, many people assume that Java and Javascript are somehow related. <br> 
                    But the two differ from each other a lot but each of them play a significant role in the IT industry. <br>
                    Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language that is platform-independent because it gets executed in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
                    While JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that helps to create dynamic HTML pages.<br>
                    Java develops applications that can run in a browser or virtual machine whereas applications made using JavaScript can run on a browser only.

                    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as, is a programming language that 
                    conforms to the ECMAScript specification. <br>
                    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. 
                    It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <br>
                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
                    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
                    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.<br>
                    JavaScript first appeared in 4th Decemebr 1995 when it was part of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.<br>
                    "JavaScript" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States.
